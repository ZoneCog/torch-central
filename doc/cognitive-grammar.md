# Cognitive Grammar Architecture for torch-central

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a distributed cognitive grammar architecture for torch-central, transforming the framework into a network of agentic cognitive nodes with hypergraph-based memory and neural-symbolic reasoning capabilities.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Subsystems

The cognitive architecture consists of four primary subsystems:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Repository: torch-central] --> B[Memory Subsystem<br/>(Distributed Knowledge Nodes)]
    A --> C[Task Subsystem<br/>(Agentic Orchestration Layer)]
    A --> D[AI Analytics Subsystem<br/>(Neural-Symbolic Reasoning)]
    A --> E[Autonomy Subsystem<br/>(Self-Modifying Agents)]

    B --> B1[Semantic Memory Store]
    B --> B2[Perceptual Buffer]
    C --> C1[Task Decomposition Engine]
    C --> C2[Attention Allocation Control]
    D --> D1[Symbolic Operator Engine]
    D --> D2[Tensor Field Mapper]
    E --> E1[Meta-Cognitive Self-Reflection]
    E --> E2[Adaptive Hypergraph Reconfiguration]
```

### 2. Distributed Agentic Network

Each agent operates as a hypergraph node with unique tensor dimensions and cognitive capabilities:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Distributed Network
        AG1[Agent Node 1<br/>Memory: Tensor A<br/>Task: Parse]
        AG2[Agent Node 2<br/>Memory: Tensor B<br/>Task: Learn]
        AG3[Agent Node 3<br/>Memory: Tensor C<br/>Task: Reason]
        AG4[Agent Node 4<br/>Memory: Tensor D<br/>Task: Modify]
    end

    AG1 -- "Semantic Link" --> AG2
    AG2 -- "Activation Flow" --> AG3
    AG3 -- "Meta-Cognitive Feedback" --> AG4
    AG4 -- "Attention Signal" --> AG1

    subgraph Cognitive Grammar Kernel
        K1[Hypergraph Pattern 1]
        K2[Hypergraph Pattern 2]
    end

    AG1 -- "Kernel Embed" --> K1
    AG2 -- "Kernel Embed" --> K2
    AG3 -- "Kernel Embed" --> K1
    AG4 -- "Kernel Embed" --> K2
```

### 3. Cognitive Grammar Flow

The cognitive processing pipeline demonstrates how data flows through the system:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Input as External Input
    participant Buffer as Perceptual Buffer
    participant CG as Cognitive Grammar
    participant Memory as Semantic Memory
    participant Task as Task Orchestrator
    participant Agent as Agentic Node
    participant Output as System Output

    Input->>Buffer: Raw data input
    Buffer->>CG: Preprocessed patterns
    CG->>Memory: Pattern encoding
    Memory->>CG: Memory retrieval
    CG->>Task: Cognitive task creation
    Task->>Agent: Task assignment
    Agent->>CG: Task processing
    CG->>Output: Processed result
    Agent->>Agent: Meta-cognitive feedback
```

### 4. Memory Synchronization Network

Distributed memory synchronization across the cognitive network:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Memory Network
        M1[Memory Node 1<br/>Semantic Store A]
        M2[Memory Node 2<br/>Semantic Store B]
        M3[Memory Node 3<br/>Semantic Store C]
        M4[Memory Node 4<br/>Semantic Store D]
    end
    
    subgraph Synchronization Layer
        S1[Sync Protocol 1<br/>Full Sync]
        S2[Sync Protocol 2<br/>Incremental]
        S3[Sync Protocol 3<br/>Priority-based]
    end
    
    M1 <--> S1
    M2 <--> S2
    M3 <--> S3
    M4 <--> S1
    
    S1 <--> S2
    S2 <--> S3
    S3 <--> S1
```

local input = torch.randn(64, 32)
local result = grammar:process(input, 'activation')

-- Store pattern in memory
grammar:storeMemory(result, 1)
```

local agent2 = torch.AgenticNode({
    nodeId = 'agent_002', 
    nodeType = 'learner',
    autonomyLevel = 0.6
})

-- Connect agents
agent1:connectToAgent(agent2, 'bidirectional', 0.8)

-- Add tasks
agent1:addTask('parse', torch.randn(64, 32), 2)
agent2:addTask('learn', torch.randn(64, 32), 1)
