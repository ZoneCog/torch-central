hash_64 - 64 bit Fowler/Noll/Vo-0 FNV-1a hash code

Fowler/Noll/Vo hash

The basis of this hash algorithm was taken from an idea sent
as reviewer comments to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2 committee by:
     Phong Vo (http://www.research.att.com/info/kpv/)
     Glenn Fowler (http://www.research.att.com/~gsf/)

In a subsequent ballot round:

     Landon Curt Noll (http://www.isthe.com/chongo/)

improved on their algorithm.  Some people tried this hash
and found that it worked rather well.  In an EMail message
to Landon, they named it the ``Fowler/Noll/Vo'' or FNV hash.

FNV hashes are designed to be fast while maintaining a low
collision rate. The FNV speed allows one to quickly hash lots
of data while maintaining a reasonable collision rate.  See:

     http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/fnv/index.html

for more details as well as other forms of the FNV hash.


To use the recommended 64 bit FNV-1a hash, pass FNV1A_64_INIT as the
Fnv64_t hashval argument to fnv_64a_buf() or fnv_64a_str().
