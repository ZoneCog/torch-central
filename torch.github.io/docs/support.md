# Need help?

**Torch** is largely community-maintained, but we are very friendly and helpful.

## Google Groups

Many developers and users answer your questions on the **[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/embed/?place=forum%2Ftorch7#!forum/torch7)**  
**Installation issues can be reported here.**

## GitHub issues

The **[GitHub issues](https://github.com/torch/torch7/issues)** page is a good place to find answers, and report issues for the core Torch package.
Each package has it's own issue tracker, for example: **[nn issues](https://github.com/torch/nn/issues)**, **[optim issues](https://github.com/torch/optim/issues)**

## Chat/IM
Some of us hangout here in this **[online chatroom](https://gitter.im/torch/torch7)**  
**Anything except INSTALLATION problems** can be discussed here. Posting install issues or logs here can lead to a ban. For install issues, use the Google Groups.
